# Todolist

This is a web app I created along an assignment challenge from a online web development bootcamp course.

It is a todo-list app using the following technology:
  1. EJS for templating the pages
  2. node.js for server-side rendering
  3. heroku for the app deployment 
  4. mongoDB as the database
  
The following link is the link to the deployed web app:

How to use this app?
  1. Type into the text space for a new todo Item
  2. Press the "+" button to add the item to the todo list
  3. Delete the item by clicking the checkbox.
 
Additional feature: You can create your own todo list simply by typing into the url:

Have fun trying it!
